I am currently a PhD student at the [Spribille lab](https://spribillelab.wordpress.com) at University of Alberta. I study the evolution of fungal-algal symbioses, known as lichens. For my current project, I apply bioinformatics methods combined with wet-lab techniques to try to understand how microbial partners communicate in the symbiotic setting and what each of them contributes to the system.
