In 2023-2024, I was teaching a MSc course on Data Science at The Sainsbury Laboratory, together with Dan McLean and Alison MacFadyen. The course covered statistics, data visualization, and intro to genomics and transcriptomics, and used a combination of bootcamp-style practical lessons and flipped-classroom sessions.

During my masters and PhD, I worked as a graduate teaching assistant for several biology classes. At the University of Alberta, I taught labs for:
* BIOL108 Introduction to Biodiversity: a first-level class in biology, and
* BOT306 Biology of the Fungi: a senior undergrad-level class.

At the St. Petersburg University, I TAed a field course on fungi, lichens, and algae.

Mentoring
======
* In 2024-2025, I am supervising Jasper Raistrick, a BSc student at the University of East Anglia during his 1-year work placement at TSL

* In 2024, I supervised the MSc thesis project of Benjamin Adjei, a MSc student at TSL. Benjamin's project focused on predicting and characterizing potential effectors in lichen secretome

* In 2023, I co-supervised Flurin Lauchli, a MSc student during a research internship in TSL.

* In 2020-2022, I co-supervising Samantha Pederson, an undergraduate researcher at the Spribille Lab. Samantha completed two term projects: on lichen-inhabiting Tremella and on symbiont composition in Hypogymina lichens, and one summer internship.

Carpentries
======
As of 2023, I am a certified instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), an organization dedicated to teaching data science and programming skills

Guest Lectures
======
I also have given a number of guest lectures, both at the University of Alberta, and elsewhere:

* 2021: Introduction to research in ecology and evolutionary biology (Stanford University)

* 2020:
    * Biology of the Fungi (UAlberta)

    * Introduction to Graph Theory (UAlberta) [Watch on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5TWZaQI8Hc&ab_channel=SeidonAlsaody%27sMathChannel)

* 2019:
    * Biology of the Fungi (UAlberta)

    * Microbial Diversity and Evolution (UAlberta)

    * Experimental Biology (UAlberta)
