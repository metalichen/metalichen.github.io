During my masters and PhD, I worked as a graduate teaching assistant for several biology classes. At the University of Alberta, I taught labs for:
* BIOL108 Introduction to Biodiversity: a first-level class in biology, and
* BOT306 Biology of the Fungi: a senior undergrad-level class.

At the St. Petersburg University, I TAed a field course on biology of the fungi, lichens, and algae.

Guest Lectures
======
I also have given a number of guest lectures, both at the University of Alberta, and elsewhere:

* 2021: Introduction to research in ecology and evolutionary biology (Stanford University)

* 2020: Biology of the Fungi (UAlberta)

    * Introduction to Graph Theory (UAlberta) [Watch on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5TWZaQI8Hc&ab_channel=SeidonAlsaody%27sMathChannel)

* 2019: Biology of the Fungi (UAlberta)

    * Microbial Diversity and Evolution (UAlberta)

    * Experimental Biology (UAlberta)

Mentoring
======
In Winter 2020, I started co-supervising Samantha Pederson, an undergraduate researcher at the Spribille Lab. Samantha did a term project on lichen inhabiting Tremella, and presented a poster at the Canadian Botanical Association Virtual Meeting in June 2020. Currently, we are working together on another project
