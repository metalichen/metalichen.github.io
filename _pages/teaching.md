During my masters and PhD, I worked as a graduate teaching assistant for several biology classes. At the University of Alberta, I taught labs for:
* BIOL108 Introduction to Biodiversity: a first-level class in biology, and
* BOT306 Biology of the Fungi: a senior undergrad-level class.

At the St. Petersburg University, I TAed a field course on biology of the fungi, lichens, and algae.

Carpentries

As of 2023, I am a certified instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), an organization dedicated to teaching data science and programming skills

Guest Lectures

I also have given a number of guest lectures, both at the University of Alberta, and elsewhere:

* 2021: Introduction to research in ecology and evolutionary biology (Stanford University)

* 2020:
    * Biology of the Fungi (UAlberta)

    * Introduction to Graph Theory (UAlberta) [Watch on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5TWZaQI8Hc&ab_channel=SeidonAlsaody%27sMathChannel)

* 2019:
    * Biology of the Fungi (UAlberta)

    * Microbial Diversity and Evolution (UAlberta)

    * Experimental Biology (UAlberta)

Mentoring
======
* In 2023, I co-supervised Flurin Lauchli, a MSc student during a research internship in TSL.

* In 2020-2022, I co-supervising Samantha Pederson, an undergraduate researcher at the Spribille Lab. Samantha completed two term projects: on lichen inhabiting Tremella and on symbiont composition in Hypogymina lichens, and one summer internship.
