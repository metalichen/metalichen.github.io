In this blogpost I plan to keep an updated list of resources I found most useful in my professional development. Mostly for myself, but would be happy if someone too finds them useful.

A lot of important things in academia (and elsewhere too, I can imagine) you kind of learn as you go. The so-called soft skills are rarely taught explicitly, and everyone is expected to find their own path. I recently started spending more time trying to fill some of the gaps in my training - which means going through piles of resources in different topics, from writing to project management. Some of these resources were more helpful than others.


## Scientific Writing
Scientific writing is a huge topic with many component parts, so I roughly grouped the resources based on the sub-topic they devote the most attention to. Of course, there is a lot of overlap between any two of these resources.

### Sentence and paragraph level
* A free [online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite) by Kristin Sainani from Stanford University. Covers all topics, including science communication and peer review. For me the most useful part was the hands-on exercises for writing clear sentences and structuring paragraphs. Demo videos of the course instructor editing texts is also extremely insightful.
* An [article](https://www.americanscientist.org/blog/the-long-view/the-science-of-scientific-writing) by George Gopen & Judith Swan with a set of concrete recommendations on how to improve the flow by changing structure on the sentence and paragraph levels.

### Manuscript-level
*  [The Scientistâ€™s Guide to Writing](https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/the-scientists-guide-to-writing/) by Stephen Heard. This book covers all aspects of writing a scientific article. For me, the most useful parts were about the high-level structure of a paper, and the advice on the writing process.

### Scientific Storytelling
* [Writing Science: How to Write Papers That Get Cited and Proposals That Get Funded](https://books.google.ca/books/about/Writing_Science.html?id=mPGYHO2QzngC&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y) by Joshua Schimel focuses on how to find a good story in your data and tell it in the most compelling way. I haven't finished the book yet, but love it so far.

## Making Figures
* A free [textbook](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) "Fundamentals of Data Visualization" by Claus O. Wilke. Covers common types of charts and graphs and dos and don'ts in data visualization.
* WANTED: a resource on how to make good conceptual figures

## Data Management, Organizational Skills, and Reproducible Research
* An amazing [series of tutorials](https://riffomonas.org/reproducible_research/) by Pat Schloss covering project organization and principles of reproducible research for computational biology. Start at the very beginning (e.g., folder structure for a project and how to work at a server), covers principles of documentation, version control using git, scripting, and how to collaborate with others.
* A [blogpost](https://bioinformaticsworkbook.org/projectManagement/Intro_projectManagement#gsc.tab=0) with a slightly different take on the same question. For my projects, I ended up using a combination of both approaches.


## Project Management for Academia
A new frontier for me! After I realized that a big portion of my time and mindspace is now taken by planning my PhD project (I have ~1 year left, and I am working on four papers as the first author, one of which is a collaboration between four labs!), I decided to learn the tools and best practices for project management. Will add more soon, and for now:
* A [series of blogposts](https://thenewpi.blogspot.com/2018/03/why-you-should-care-about-project.html?m=1) in the New PI Blog called Project Management for Academia 101. Covers basic definitions, explains the difference between the two main PM approaches, and gives an example of how the PM techniques can be applied to a PhD project and to managing a lab.

## Mentoring and Supervising
* A [guide](https://www.ppd.admin.cam.ac.uk/files/mentoring_guide_2020_v3.pdf) from Cambridge University on how to be a good mentor. Food for thought.

## Career in Academia
* [The Professor Is In](https://theprofessorisin.com/) book and blog. I obviously don't have enough expertise to judge, but I found this very interesting: a former department chair writes about the academic job market and how to prepare for it. I really liked the direct no-bullshit approach.
